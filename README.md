## Turn idle back yards into fresh fruits and veggies ##

This project grew out of my own personal frustrations with finding a
garden to grow vegetables. I live in Boston, and gardening is
impossible. As an alternative, I signed up for the Fenway Gardens, and
I never heard back from them.

At Vampire Hackathon, we thought, "hey, what about people sharing
vegetable gardens?" and Parcel happened.
